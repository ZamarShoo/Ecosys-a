									* An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
									Protocol (TCP/IP) network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route
									information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that
									is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers
									to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate 
									on the Internet, browse and shop.
									<br><br>
									** A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the global address of documents and other resources on the
									World Wide Web.
